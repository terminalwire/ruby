# Commercial License

If you would like to use Terminalwire without complying with the AGPLv3 license (for example, if you do not want to release your modifications or if you're embedding it into a commercial product), you may purchase a commercial license.

This allows you to:
- Use Terminalwire in closed-source products
- Modify it without open-sourcing your changes
- Avoid AGPL disclosure requirements

To obtain a commercial license, contact:
